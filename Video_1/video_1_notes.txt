Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform, Docker is a containerization tool, and a container is the lightweight runtime unit that holds your application and its dependencies. They work together but serve distinct roles.
🧭 Kubernetes vs Docker vs Container: Core Differences
		
🧱 What is a Container?
•	A container packages an application and its dependencies into a single unit.
•	It runs consistently across environments (dev, test, prod).
•	Examples: Nginx container, Python app container.

🐳 What is Docker?
•	Docker is a container engine that builds and runs containers.
•	It uses Dockerfiles to define images and Docker CLI to manage them.
•	Docker simplifies development and testing by isolating environments.

☸️ What is Kubernetes?
•	Kubernetes is a container orchestration system.
•	It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
•	It works with container engines like containerd, CRI-O, or Docker (deprecated).

🧪 How They Work Together
1.	Docker builds and runs containers.
2.	Containers hold your app and run on nodes.
3.	Kubernetes manages those containers across a cluster:
•	Ensures availability
•	Restarts failed containers
•	Scales up/down based on load
•	Handles networking and storage

🔁 Summary Analogy
•	Container = The app in a sealed box.
•	Docker = The machine that builds and runs the box.
•	Kubernetes = The warehouse manager that places, monitors, and scales boxes across shelves.
